<h1>Contactless Emv Card Reader</h1>
<p>
    This application reads EMV contactless cards and displays key information about card read on the terminal screen.  Technically, a new transaction is initiated on the card - the data generated
    by the card might then be used in a real transaction process.
</p>
<p>
    By selecting the "Set Terminal Tags" button, you can change any parameter used for the transaction.
    By default, the application simulates an offline-only terminal using CDA data authentication, a small transaction amount, and clean TVR results.  If the card supports offline and CDA,
    it should generate a transaction certificate.
</p>
<p>
    If your card can not be read, there might be several reasons
    <ul>
    <li>Contactless not active or disabled on the card</li>
    <li>Card does not accept offline and/or CDA transactions -> change "Terminal Type" and "Generate AC P1" options</li>
    <li>Card requests unusual tags from the application</li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    You can send the FULL Communication log by email.  The data being sent is <b>very sensitive</b> and might be used to withdraw money from your card.
    Since eMail is not a secure communication channel, I would not advice to use this feature with unblocked production cards.
